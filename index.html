                    As a teenage kid, I have a wide list of hobbies, the main one being coding and gaming. Due to my lack of social skills, I don't see myself engaging in social activities much, as I spend most of my free time indoors. This leads to me being introduced to both said hobbies.</p>
        
                    <p class="about-me-p">Coding has been my hobby for quite some time. Its gives me satisfaction whenever I get things right and as I improve I grow aware of how vast the world of programming is. Whether I'm crafting a sleek website, tinkering with interactive apps, or unraveling the mysteries of algorithms, coding is my way of painting a portrait of innovation. It's my sanctuary of problem-solving and innovation and I wish to make this hobby something that I can make a living out of.
